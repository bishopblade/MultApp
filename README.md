# Multiplication Game

## Summary
I created this game as an educational tool a while ago. The code is partially broken. Beware.

## Installation
`git clone` the repo.

cd to the server/ directory, then run `npm install`.

Start the server by running `npm start` in the server/ directory.

You will also have to host the client part of the website. You can do this with Python 3 by going to the public/ directory, then running `python3 -m http.server`. If you do this, the game should be available at `http://localhost:8000`.
